# PythonLinearRegression
A linear Regression class with a test example in python ready to be used for more complex stuff created by me


*currently a temp fix for it to work with negative coefficients of 'x' and can't do y intercepts of less than 1e-4 because of floating point errors and is just a proof of concept 
Please use the the newest possible release as they will have updated code and bug fixes etc
